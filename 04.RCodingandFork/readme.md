# Forking and Compartmentalized R Coding
Ok, we've made a repo, cloned it to our PC, made local changes, and then pushed those changes to github. That's awesome, we're doing big things, look at us go!

We can still go a step beyond, and download other people's repos. This is great for either collaborating, or just using someone's package, code, etc.

We can also use Github to compartmentalize our R coding within our repo to be even more efficient for downstream analysis, and sharing with collaborators. 

Here, we'll do both.

Before we can get started on this though, we're going to 'fork' this repo, which means we'll create a copy of it in our github. We'll then pull it to our local machine.

This demonstration will be using a separate repo (a really cool one that uses SNP data to estimate dispersal distances), since I can't fork my own repo. But the steps are the same, so you shouldn't have any hiccups.

To fork this repo, go to the main page for this [Github repo](https://www.github.com/rhyacotritonriot/RAFWE.WFGRS.2023). On the top right, you'll see an option for 'Fork'. Go ahead and click the little arrow to the right of it, and select the option to create a new fork.

You should see this page, where you can choose to rename the repository, but what you'll do is copy the repo to your own account as its own repository. Go ahead and smash that 'create fork' button!

Great! Now you should see the name of this repo, but under your own account name, and the info of where it came from below.

Now, open up github desktop, and click the add button, to clone this repo

![forkingdemo](https://github.com/rhyacotritonriot/RAFWE.WFGRS.2023/blob/main/image.files/fork.4.jpg?raw=true)

---

You should see the forked repo as an option, and the icon tells you that it's a fork. Go ahead and hit clone, to download the entire repo to your local machine.

---

You'll see a message, asking what you're planning to do. Are you planning on contributing, or just using it for yourself? In this case, hit the 'for my own purposes' button, and continue.

---

Awesome! Now, open up file explorer, and you'll see that the whole repo and all of its files have been downloaded to your local machine!

# Great, now we're ready to continue on to the compartmentalized R coding section

Go ahead and open the [folder](https://github.com/rhyacotritonriot/RAFWE.WFGRS.2023/tree/main/04.RCodingandFork) containing the R markdown files and the folders for all of the output for each file. 

Run them in this order:
1. R_Simulate
2. R_Modeling
3. R_Graphing
4. R_Analysis

**Important Note: You'll need to change the path in the 'set working directory' code to the one you forked the repo to for the code to run, do this for each script**
